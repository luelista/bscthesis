\begin{abstract}
%=====================================================================

Multipath TCP is an extension to the Transmission Control Protocol to support the use of multiple paths between hosts with multiple interfaces.  There are several algorithms to schedule data segments over multiple paths, each making a different trade-off between throughput, resource utilization, reliability, delay and jitter. Even though Multipath TCP has is fully backwards compatibility towards the applications layer, %\cite{RFC6182}
we can reap performance benefits by enabling the application to select a scheduling algorithm based on its internal information about content types, priorities, dependencies and user expectations.
Therefore, we modify a HTTP/2 web server to pass scheduling hints to the Multipath TCP scheduler via socket options. The scheduling algorithms are developed in a scripting language for easier evaluation.
An evaluation is performed in simulated and real-world environments over LTE and WiFi.

% reasoning why mptcp is/will be used on devices people browse the internet with
Most smart phones and notebooks have multiple network interfaces nowadays. This has given rise to the design of various network protocols with the aim of extending bandwidth, enhancing reliability and lowering power consumption by intelligently combining interfaces. One of these is Multipath TCP  \cite{RFC6824_MPTCP}, an extension to the Transmission Control Protocol with support for combining multiple paths over multiple interfaces into a single TCP connection with higher bandwidth and reliability.


% users expect faster/instant reaction from computers/web pages/interactive services ^= do not accept (long) wait times
% web sites getting more complex
% 
% very short intro to mptcp, evtl. richtung vorteile für clients/webbrowsing
% "`more and more devices are mobile"'
% "`almost every modern device has multiple network interfaces"' (smartphones cell+wifi, notebooks eth+wifi(+cell), desktops eth+wifi, household routers with multi uplink dsl+lte, etc)



Inherent in Multipath TCP operation is some overhead of discovering and establishing multiple paths when the connection is set up. In regular web browsing, HTTP up to version 1.1 use many short-lived TCP connections, so the overhead of multipath initialization can shatter the performance improvements of Multipath TCP, as the connection often is closed before the second path is usable. Combined with unadapted browsers, this can cause Multipath TCP to have worse performance than single path TCP \cite{han2015mwebmptcp}.


% very short intro to http/2, maybe difference to http/1(.1)
% "`websites become more intricate"'
The web has come a long way since the introduction of HTTP/0.9 in 1993. Many small improvements have been made in the meantime, all carefully providing backward compatibility. But web applications have become so intricate, and users so accustomed to responsive interactive services, that a clear break had to be made. Therefore, HTTP/2 \cite{RFC7540_HTTP2} has been specified. To allow easier adaption, the semantics were kept intact, while the underlying protocol was changed completely: A only seemingly simple text-based protocol was replaced with a more efficient, precisely specified binary protocol. 
The new feature most relevant to us are multiplexed streams which allow all data to be transferred over few, long-lived, thus more efficient TCP connections. The multiplexing also prevents head-of-line blocking and allows prioritizing the most time-critical resources.

% two schedulers (
% - http2 schedules frames from multiple streams into one tls/tcp connection, mostly based on http2 priority;
% - mptcp schedules tcp segments from one meta socket onto multiple real sockets
% )
% three layers

As opposed to older versions, HTTP/2 is based on long-lived TCP connections. Therefore it can utilize the additional sub-flow capacity more often. During a single connection, different types of requests are processed, including loading a document and resources required to display it, loading auxiliary content like images below the fold, and user-initiated AJAX requests. Every type of request has different performance needs, which makes it especially interesting for cooperation-based optimization approaches.

% different scheduling approaches for mptcp are possible, many have been proposed and some are implemented in the linux kernel

% assumption: choosing best possible scheduling strategy depends on requirements of(/knowledge about/knowledge available to implementation of) higher level protocols 
% even for one given protocol, these requirements can change during a connection (e.g. web site: initial loading should be fast - user is waiting - use fastest flow(s)/use redundancy, loading of images below the fold don't need to be as fast -> conserve power/metered traffic, ajax requests might be small, but latency critical -> redundancy)
We assume that choosing the best possible Multipath TCP subflow scheduling strategy depends on information about the higher layers. In the case of HTTP/2 connections this information includes the type of the request as indicated above. For having this information available to the packet scheduler - part of the transport layer - there are several possible solutions, each coming with different pros and cons. 
% for some protocols, a good heuristical approach can be chosen based on transmitted bytes, time, transmission pauses, etc
For one, a heuristic approach can be chosen, which acts on metadata readily available in the transport layer, including transmission rate and pauses, elapsed time, and byte and packet counters. The good thing is that this approach is independent of the specific implementation of the application protocol, and can even work unchanged for several similar protocols. 
% for some protocols, the scheduler could look into the octet stream and decide depending on contents
% problems:
% -> breaks separation of layers - high "`dirty hack"' factor
% -> protocol decoding needs to be implemented in scheduler (os kernel!) -> proto updates need kernel updates, security problems (protocol parser is huge attack surface)
% -> impossible with encrypted protocols (not technically impossible, but would be very complicated and has performance hit)
Even more information about the state of higher level protocols can be gained by inspecting the octet stream itself. This brings with it all problems of Deep Packet Inspection, including security risks and increased code complexity \cite{Porter2005}. It is also not applicable to HTTP/2 as all browsers implement it with forced TLS encryption, therefore this approach is not considered any further.
% solution / our approach: the implementation of the higher level protocol provides special scheduling hints to the mptcp scheduler
% pro
% - no detailed knowledge about the protocol is neccessary in the scheduler
% - with a good api, the scheduler needs to know nothing about the specific application level protocol, while the app level proto implementation needs to know (almost) nothing about the network level scheduling
% contra
% - every application which should take advantage of this approach needs to be specifically modified
% - 
The middle road we suggest is providing an API which allows the application to provide scheduling hints to the transport layer. This has the advantage of not embedding knowledge about the application layer protocol in the scheduler, thereby keeping the abstraction layers separate.


%---------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Approach}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------

%\todob{conceptual approach}
%wie vorgehen - konzeptioneller approach
%interaction / dependency -> lösen durch cooperation
We start by analyzing the general structure of popular web sites regarding the resources on the critical path. In comparison, we look at guidelines for performance optimization in web design. 
From the gained insights, we conceive possible optimizations for existing, modified or specially crafted web pages at the transport level. The Multipath TCP implementation \cite{multipathtcp} consists of three major building blocks: path manager, packet scheduler and connection to the subflows \cite{RFC6182}. In this thesis, we pay special attention to the packet scheduler. More precisely, we concentrate on its component which spreads individual segments over subflows. These optimized schedulers are implemented in rule-based scripts which are loaded into the MPTCP implementation in the Linux kernel. To make scheduling hints like content type, priorities or dependencies available to the scheduler scripts, we modify a suitable HTTP/2-capable web server to pass on these hints as socket options. 

%auch implement. und eval approach
The next step is an evaluation of the implemented optimizations in simulated network environments. Web sites are loaded in network scenarios differing in bandwidth, round trip time and packet loss. To study the practicality, we conduct real-world measurements for the best-performing optimizations, connecting from LTE and domestic ADSL access networks to virtual servers at a cloud provider.

\section{Structure}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------
% where we provide an overview of the chapters

% background/rel. work
In the following chapter, we introduce the protocols on which this work is based. This is Multipath TCP on the transport layer, which is described with a focus on scheduling. On the application layer, the HTTP/2 protocol and its underlying concepts. A review of related publications is conducted, with a focus on  Multipath TCP scheduling, coordination among software layers, cooperation between kernel and user-space components, web page optimization, and performance measurement of web pages and applications.

%approach
Chapter four starts with an analysis of typical web page structures, details our approach for passing scheduling hints from application to transport layer and presents optimized MPTCP scheduler rules for different network scenarios. We also consider security concerns regarding the scheduling hints as a side channel to TLS encryption.

%implementation
Following our approach of integrating multiple layers, the implementation described in chapter five ranges from the network layer up to the application layer. Optimized schedulers were realized with a scripting-enabled rule based scheduler in the Linux kernel. After conducting a survey of web server software, we choose one to customize. This is necessary to pass information about HTTP requests down the stack, bypassing encryption. On top of that, we created sample web pages and applications.


%evaluation
To show which optimizations are worth using in which network situations, in chapter five, we evaluate the performance of the implemented schedulers in simulated and real-world networks. We conduct measurements including the resource usage, like transmitted data volume per interface, and record timestamps of all events in the browser, to calculate various page load speed metrics. Based on that data, we relate the added value for the user to potential computational overhead and bandwidth costs.


%their actual and perceived speed, utility to the user, overall and per-interface bandwidth usage, (power usage?), computational overhead, implementation difficulty, 

%conclusion
Finally, a conclusion is drawn on the accomplished improvements, which approaches were successful and which less so. We also use the last chapter to point out possible future work.

\section{Performance of Web Traffic on Multipath TCP}


%HTTP/1.1 mostly benefits from Multipath TCP for larger file downloads because the TCP connections are often closed after one download, whereas the overhead of establishing auxilliary paths is not worthwile for downloading only one small file. In some studies it has been shown that the HTTP/1.1 performance is worse with MPTCP that with single path TCP on the same connection. Especially the common HTTP/1.1 optimization practice of sharding (spreading files among many different origins).
 
Inherent in Multipath TCP operation is some overhead of discovering and establishing multiple paths when the connection is set up. Older versions of HTTP use many short-lived TCP connections, so the overhead of multipath initialization can shatter the performance improvements of Multipath TCP. Combined with unmatched expectations of the browser, there are situations where Multipath TCP can hurt the HTTP/1.1 performance compared with single path TCP \cite{han2015mwebmptcp}.

\section{Cooperation of Application Layer and Transport Layer}

% technical problems to be solved:
% *api needs to be defined
% *there might be a layer in between (Presentation Layer, TLS omnipresent today)

There are two main technical challenges in cooperation between (network) layers:

The first is that an adequate API needs to be defined. This is tricky especially in our case, the cooperation of application and transport layer, as one side is in user space and the other is a kernel component in modern operating systems.

The second challenge results from the fact that these layers are not directly adjacent to each other: In our case it is TLS encryption, which operates in the presentation layer, making all application layer data opaque to layers below. Therefore, a side channel needs to be established to allow information flow around the TLS encryption.

\chapter{Approach}
%=====================================================================


	
%Annahmen:
We will describe a few assumptions made for the implementation and all optimizations.
%TCP-Verbindung wird immer vom Browser aufgebaut
First, we always look at a MPTCP connection which is established by the web browser and accepted by the web server. This is always the case for HTTP connections.
%Nur der Client/Browser hat mehrere Interfaces / sendet MP JOIN Anfragen -> path-manager erstmal nicht relevant
Only the client has two interfaces with different network addresses. After the connection is set up, it directly opens the second subflow by connecting to the server from the secondary interface with a \code{MP\_JOIN} option in the \code{SYN}. The server has only one (visible) interface and accepts the second subflow. Therefore we won't discuss different MPTCP path management algorithms.
%Client hat zwei Interfaces (Wi-Fi und 3G)
The client's interfaces are either Wi-Fi and 3G/LTE, as found on smart phones, or Ethernet and Wi-Fi, which is common for notebooks.
%Kontrollierbare Aspekte: 
%	- Scheduler
%	- TCP Flow Control/Congestion Control




\section{Analysis of web page behaviour}



\section{Interaction between transport and application layer}

%Wie dem Scheduler mitteilen was er tun soll?
%Problem: Wie erfolgt Kommunikation mit dem mptcp-scheduler? Zwischen mptcp und http2 sitzt in der regel noch tls! -> Paketinhalt für mptcp-scheduler nicht lesbar - evtl. über byte-counter


%Wo kommt die Logik hin?
%	- a: Server taggt Frames irgendwie, z.B. Inhalt=PageContent / Bild / Script / Style; Push=Ja/Nein; etc…, und Scheduler enthält die Logik die sagt was mit welchem Frame-Typ passieren soll
%oder b: Server gibt genaue Anweisung an Scheduler, dieser setzt es nur um
A decision we need to make is where to place the optimization logic. One approach is that the server tags every HTTP/2 frame with information like content or stream type, and the scheduler script decides that to do exactly. This way, there is maximum flexibility for the MPTCP configuration and the server doesn't need to know very much about MPTCP. On the other hand, we need special handling on the scheduler level for every application protocol we want to optimize.
The other approach is to have several general scheduler algorithms, each with different performance trade-offs, while allowing the application to decide which scheduler algorithm should be enabled. This reduces the dependencies on the scheduler level, but required more MPTCP specific decision making on the application level. 





\section{Optimizing the Multipath TCP scheduler}

Several optimization approaches are considered in this chapter.

\subsection{Switching the scheduler based on content type or priority}
Many modern web pages consist of dozens of resources. They can be classified by their technical priority for rendering the page. 

1. The \textit{Document} is the main HTML file which is loaded first. It is strictly necessary for the browser to render the page, and to load subsequent resources. 

2. Synchronous Javascript resources (\code{<script>} tags) are required by the browser to construct the Document Object Model (DOM) tree. They must be loaded as soon as the tag is parsed by the browser.

3. Style sheets are needed for the first layout cycle of the page, which means usually nothing is displayed to the user until they are fully loaded.

4. Images can be loaded after the base frame of the site is visible, especially if the image size is provided in the Document source. The same is true for video, audio and most AJAX requests.

...

One can also look at their subjective utility to the user.

In the case of text heavy pages, like news sites, the Document and some images are most useful to the user as that contains the content of the page. In these cases, the Javascript resources are often providing tracking and advertising, so very important for the webmaster but annoying for the user. Especially tracking scripts can be delivered with lower priority as they are invisible and not time critical.

For interactive pages, the Javascript might provide all the relevant contents.   

...  ... 

Modern browsers and speed-optimized web pages make sure that the resources with the highest technical priority are requested first. The HTTP/2 server can also facilitate this by pushing out high-priority resources with HTTP Push.

The resources required for the first layout cycle will be handled by a scheduler with emphasis on low latency, like a redundant scheduler on lossy connections. The redundant scheduler sends all segments out on all paths to minimize delays caused by packet loss.

After these high priority resources are sent out, a regular, more bandwidth conserving scheduler can be used.



\subsection{Aggressive transmission of last segments}
The transmitting application signals the state of its outgoing buffers to the scheduler. An interesting condition occurs when the HTTP server has no more data to send, and only a few segments are left in the scheduler's queue. This means only these few segments are missing so that a complete web page can be rendered for the user. The scheduler can try to push out the missing segments more aggressively: By temporarily ignoring the available congestion window for the left over bytes, or by retransmitting on all available subflows.





\section{Security Considerations}
The information passed from the HTTP server to the MPTCP scheduler creates a side channel bypassing TLS encryption. It needs to be considered whether the passed data or the observable scheduler decisions based on this data could help an adversary. Some information are only protected by HTTP/2 and would be exposed on HTTP/1.1 connections anyway, like the length of individual resources. Others, like the content type, might be not available to the attacker otherwise.

\section{Application Layer - HTTP 2}


\subsection{Choosing a web server platform}

To get information about the contents of the HTTP/2 application data, the cooperation of the web server is required.

Multiple web servers have been evaluated and based on the criteria set out below, a suitable implementation basis has been selected.

As we want to implement low-level modifications in the web server, the source code has to be available, and the license must permit modifications. This is a strictly necessary criterion, but luckily, most available web servers are permissively open source licensed under Apache, MIT or similar licenses.

To be at all useful, the server must support HTTP/2, and support it with at least one common browser as client. 

To make the work more relevant for practical use, a popular web server should be used. Therefore, we started our evaluation with the Apache HTTP Server

% overview of the chapter

% 1. decisions we made which have an impact on the evaluation:
%  -- using real web sites / hand-crafted sample web sites
%  -- if real web sites: which web sites to measure, how to prepare them for measurement
% - evaluation setup:
%  -- which browser to use for measurement

%  -- time to DOM Ready (doc + blocking scripts)

%     - can be measured as the time of the last change above the fold
%  -- time to "`text ready"' (useful e.g. on newspaper sites where most users want to read the content only/first, but lot of slow crap is shown above the fold)

% 2. how the measurement is conducted (used browser, used additional scripts/extension to gather data from browser, additional scripts to gather transmitted data from network stack client/server side, automation, ...)
% -> this might also belong into Implementation???

% 3. results: data, graphs, observations, conclusions...



We have to decide which web sites to measure, and how to measure them.


\section{Selection of sample web pages}


- Self built test pages (plain html, small html file with many scripts/css, big html, etc ...)


Measuring the page load times of real-world web pages:

- Alexa Top Sites (or similar ranking)

- Hand-selected sites with interesting features / problems / optimization potentials

- Sites which are often used on mobile

\section{Preparation of real-world web sites}

% web sites need to be prepared
% some can be used as is
% on some, changes are inevitable, they won't work otherwise (https neccessary for h2, problems with third-party requests and dynamic content, etc)
% on some, we should change stuff, e.g. because there are optimizations for http/1.1 which make things worse on http/2 and it would be unrealistic to use them in this state
% etc.

\subsection{Handling dynamic and third party requests}

Downloading web pages with browser / wget and delivering with nghttpd - Problem: how to handle dynamic or third-party requests?

\begin{itemize}
	\item Cancel/reject all third party requests (in-browser / iptables)

	Pro: Easy, reproducible

	Con: not realistic (always a lot faster than real request)

	Pro: might be faster by the same amount, so still comparable (?)

	\item Let all third party requests through to the original sites

	Pro: Easy, realistic

	Con: dependent on network condition of test computer and load on original server (not reproducible)

\end{itemize}

Alternative: Use a caching HTTP/2 proxy (nghttpx, apache)

Pro: realistic (?), reproducible, (not that difficult either)

Con: ...

\section{Outlook / Future Work}

The client (web browser) side of optimizations was mostly excluded from our considerations. 
% one might implement a mptcp protocol extension so the logic can sit mostly in browser OR webserver, and the other side is instructed what to dohe 
% another way to generalize this could be definining a way for the web page/app to give the hints to the browser, which passes them on to the client mptcp scheduler
% -> the server scheduler implementation could send the corresponding mptcp frames with the same scheduling strategy as the request

% on the other hand, a different, quite simple approach could be taken on the browser side: send regular GET requests (maybe also POST with small body) as fast, latency critical strategy, while sending big POSTs (uploads) as latency uncritical strategy
% it might be possible to do a good heuristical approach here, without support from the browser, only in the mptcp scheduler




% our work could be combined with :
Some optimizations rely on manually providing resource priorities and dependencies to the web server. Our work could be combined with automated algorithms to determine dependency graphs of web pages and user relevancy ratings of resources. Butkiewicz et al. \cite{klotski2015}

% - automated categorization of ressources/http requests

% - automated dependency graph

%Automatische Einstufung von Seitenbestandteilen (HTTP Requests) in Relevanz / User Utility
%-> nicht Thema der Arbeit, aber evtl. relevant für praktische Umsetzung

%Automatisches Aufbauen von Dependency Graphs
